## Assignment Descriptions

### HW1: Yelp Data Exploration

In this assignment, you will explore Yelp dataset to perform data exploration, work with multiple datasets, and implement data partitioning.

### HW2: Frequent Itemset Mining with Spark

Implement the SON algorithm using Apache Spark to find frequent itemsets in simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating efficient distributed computation.

### HW3: Min-Hash, LSH, and Recommendation Systems

Tasks involve implementing Min-Hash and Locality Sensitive Hashing for finding similar businesses efficiently, and creating two types of recommendation systems.

### HW4: Graph Analysis and Girvan-Newman Algorithm

Explore the Spark GraphFrames library and implement the Girvan-Newman algorithm to detect communities in graphs, focusing on efficient distributed computation.

### HW5: K-Means and BFR Clustering

Implement the K-Means and Bradley-Fayyad-Reina (BFR) clustering algorithms using synthetic datasets, gaining experience with clustering techniques.

### Competition: Recommendation System Challenge

In this competition project, you'll build a recommendation system, such as a hybrid recommendation system, to predict accurate recommendations for given user-business pairs.
